# Gemini remains the main LLM; NeMo is used here for rule-based checks / rewrites.

# No models are configured here because we are not asking NeMo to call
# another LLM. If you later want NeMo to use a separate model for more
# advanced rewriting, you can define it under `models:`.

# Rails definition: we only define an output flow that reviews the
# assistant's (Gemini) response and optionally rewrites it.
